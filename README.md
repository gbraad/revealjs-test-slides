# Hello, World!

A simple slideshow to test Reveal.js with themes

Works with:
  * Obsidian: [Advanced Slides](https://mszturc.github.io/obsidian-advanced-slides/)
  * VSCode: [vscode-reveal](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evilz.vscode-reveal)

Uses modifications like [real-black](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/3366) and the [tomorrow-night-bright theme](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/blob/main/src/styles/tomorrow-night-bright.css), as available in my Obsidian [Vault template](https://github.com/gbraad/obsidian-template).
